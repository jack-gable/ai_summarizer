# Summize

Summize is a powerful text summarizer powered by GPT-4. It allows users to simplify any articles into easily manageable summarizations that can be easily digested. This project utilizes the OpenAI API and integrates GPT-4, making text summaries quick and easy.

The user can also copy the summary to clipboard and paste in anywhere.
